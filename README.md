Welcome to Command Line Incremental!

I have been challenged to make a game using no UI.  Apart from a few ASCII graphics and a couple loading bars, everything in this program will be limited to text based input and output to islolate the logic only!

To run the game:
    1. Download CLI.py to your favored directory
    2. Open a terminal of your choice and navigate to the directory where CLI.py is installed.
    3. You can run the program by using the command:  Python3 CLI.py
    4. If you receive an error, you may need to install python by following the instructions here: https://realpython.com/installing-python/

All feedback is welcome!
Thank you for giving my little game a shot!
